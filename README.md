# ASCON-Encryption-System
This repository contains my implementation of the ASCON encryption system using SystemVerilog. ASCON (Authenticated Symmetric Cryptography Over Network) is a lightweight and efficient authenticated encryption algorithm designed for secure communication over networks.

# Features:

    SystemVerilog Implementation: The ASCON algorithm is implemented in SystemVerilog, providing a hardware description language approach for efficient hardware implementation or simulation.

    Secure Communication: ASCON ensures secure communication by providing both confidentiality and authenticity for transmitted data.

    Lightweight and Efficient: ASCON is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for resource-constrained environments.
